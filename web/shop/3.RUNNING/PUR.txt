PUREBOOST CLIMA SHOES
SHOES DESIGNED FOR MAXIMUM AIRFLOW AND MOISTURE MANAGEMENT.
Keep your feet cool during your street run in the Pureboost Clima shoes. These men's running shoes offer a knit structure with allover perforation for superior airflow over any distance. The moisture-wicking Clima yarns work to sweep sweat away from your foot for dry comfort, whether you're just starting a run or deep into a street race.
