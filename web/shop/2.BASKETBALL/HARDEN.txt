HARDEN B/E 2 SHOES
SHOES PAYING TRIBUTE TO JAMES HARDEN'S CHILDHOOD FRIENDS.
Gas, brake, cook. James Harden freezes defenders with his signature mix of Euro steps, hesitations and lightning-quick crossovers. Inspired by James Harden's "Brothers Through Everything" motto, these shoes are designed with his welded logo alongside four dots that represent his childhood friends. They are built for a snug, comfortable fit and feature extra lockdown and responsiveness as you hit the brakes and create separation from defenders with Harden's signature style.
