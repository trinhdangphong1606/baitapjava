CRAZY BYW SHOES
'90S BASKETBALL-INSPIRED SHOES WITH A PODULAR BOOST OUTSOLE.
Instantly famous for its bold, wavy midsole design, the over-the-top Crazy 8 was one of the most sensational trainers the game of basketball had ever seen. It was '97, and this flashy mid top ruled the hardwood. Inspired by the natural movement of the '90s-era FYW concept, these shoes feature a "Boost You Wear" midsole with a triple Boost pod system. On the toe cap is a tonal retro Freddy logo debossed in the original FYW trainers.
